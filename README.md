# Minimally-Strongly-Connecting-Weakly-Connected-Graphs
Mathematical proof of algorithm to find edges to minimally strongly connect a weakly connected graph and proof of the bound.

My contributions are the proof of the bound, and the proof that the bound can be attained, which I developed myself. I received invaluable assistance and support in implementing the algorithm from my coursemate, and the testing of the algorithm I did not contribute significantly to.

Having developed the algorithm, I discovered that this is a known result, although I was unable to locate a correct implementation of the algorithm or proof that I am aware of. Therefore there is no reference to an original paper with this result included. (Although the proof we have provided is relatively elementary graph theory)

As this is a proof of concept, the code is fairly rough and not optimised for performance. That said, it is heavily commented, and so should be followable.
